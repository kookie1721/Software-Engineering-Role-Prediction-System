With a mixture of technical knowledge and leadership, they oversee both the product being produced and the people performing the work. Software project managers generally work full time in an office environment, though performing extra hours is commonplace when problems need resolution or deadlines near. After years of experience, software project managers may move on to positions such as senior product manager or software engineering manager.

This helps ensure that all parties involved have a clear idea of what needs to be done and when it needs to be done by.
